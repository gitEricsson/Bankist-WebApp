## Overview

### About

Bankist is an innovative and easy-to-use internet banking service. Primary tasks like money transfers, loan requests, account closures, and balance checks are implemented by this project.

### The Challenge

My aim was to recreate Jonas' BANKIST WebApp

You can login, and make transfers to other accounts(in the "transfer to" field, any of the usernames below can be made use of) with these login credentials on the live site:

- username: er || pin: 1111
- username: js || pin: 2222
- username: jd || pin: 3333

### Features

- Simple Login functionality and Interface
- Loan granting functionality
- Ability to transfer funds to an account
- User's Transactions UI

- Toggle transactions sorting
- Current Balance display

### Updates
